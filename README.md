# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Apply machine learning to solve analyze credit card risk.


# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a supervised machine learning algorithms to predict credit card risk for loan management. Using different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes, it becomes possible to determine how to better evaluate good loans versus ricky loans. Greater confidence and accuracy in building prediction models helps companies monitor fraudulent transactions, retain customers, and to build more efficient business plans for continued growth and productivity.

# Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
